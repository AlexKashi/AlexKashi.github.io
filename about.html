                    <h1> About Alex </h1>
                    <h2> Current Work </h2>
                    <p> I am currently a researcher at the Stanford Genome Technology Center. My main objective is to help find new diagnostics methods for Chronic Fatigue Syndrom and discover potential treatments. To do this we employ the use of novel bio sensors fabricated at the nano scale. When used properly these bio senors may be able to differentiate controls from people with CFS. Unfortionatly I can not go into too much detail because the results have not been published, please keep an eye out for the publication in the coming months. </p>
                    <h2> In My Free Time </h2>
                    <p> I love to stay active by lifting weights and working out. I exercise at least 7 times a week whether it be in the gym or on a hike. And am currently trying to introduce more yoga into my routine. I try to go out every weekend with some friends to meet new people, and experience new things. I also have a passion to keep busy and find projects to work on. Like the GTM, or machine learning tasks.  </p>
                    <h2> GTM Supercar </h2> 
                    <p> I am currently helping put together a GTM with my Dad. There is a picture of me posing with it partially assembled on the left.  </p>
