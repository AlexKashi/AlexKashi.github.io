			Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating noncommunicable disease brandishing an enormous worldwide disease burden with some evidence of inherited genetic risk. Absence of measurable changes in patients’ standard blood work has necessitated ad hoc symptom-driven therapies and a dearth of mechanistic hypotheses regarding its etiology and possible cure. A new hypothesis, the indolamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) metabolic trap, was developed and formulated as a mathematical model. The historical occurrence of ME/CFS outbreaks is a singular feature of the disease and implies that any predisposing genetic mutation must be common. A database search for common damaging mutations in human enzymes produces 208 hits, including IDO2 with four such mutations. Non-functional IDO2, combined with well-established substrate inhibition of IDO1 and kinetic asymmetry of the large neutral amino acid transporter, LAT1, yielded a mathematical model of tryptophan metabolism that displays both physiological and pathological steady-states. Escape from the pathological one requires an exogenous perturbation. This model also identifies a critical point in cytosolic tryptophan abundance beyond which descent into the pathological steady-state is inevitable. If, however, means can be discovered to return cytosolic tryptophan below the critical point, return to the normal physiological steady-state is assured. Testing this hypothesis for any cell type requires only labelled tryptophan, a means to measure cytosolic tryptophan and kynurenine, and the standard tools of tracer kinetics

			There is not currently a well-established, if any, biological test to diagnose myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The molecular aberrations observed in numerous studies of ME/CFS blood cells offer the opportunity to develop a diagnostic assay from blood samples. Here we developed a nanoelectronics assay designed as an ultrasensitive assay capable of directly measuring biomolecular interactions in real time, at low cost, and in a multiplex format. To pursue the goal of developing a reliable biomarker for ME/CFS and to demonstrate the utility of our platform for point-of-care diagnostics, we validated the array by testing patients with moderate to severe ME/CFS patients and healthy controls. The ME/CFS samples’ response to the hyperosmotic stressor observed as a unique characteristic of the impedance pattern and dramatically different from the response observed among the control samples. We believe the observed robust impedance modulation difference of the samples in response to hyperosmotic stress can potentially provide us with a unique indicator of ME/CFS. Moreover, using supervised machine learning algorithms, we developed a classifier for ME/CFS patients capable of identifying new patients, required for a robust diagnostic tool.

	    <h1> Current Work </h1>
	    <p> 
  			I am currently a Researcher at the Stanford Genome Technology Center. My first publication has been recently published in PNAS, where we differentiate 20 ME/CFS patients from 20 controls using a novel biosensor. I developed all the algorithms for analyzing the large amount of impedance vs time data produced by the sensor. I designed a feature extraction method and dimensionality reduction algorithm allowing for the perfect classification of the data in PCA space using a polynomial kernel SVM.

  			Our team has recently published in Diagnostics our proposed hypothesis for the metabolic origin of ME/CFS. The hypothesis is based on algorithms I developed for flagging commonly damaged genes in severely ill ME/CFS patients. Find more <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics9030082"> here. </a>

			I am learning how to build social media applications in my free time we are currently in Alpha and will soon be rolling out beta testing. Our vision is to create a platform where users can build meaningful connections with total strangers through fast paced targeted interaction. We allow users to seamlessly interface between two social paradigms. An active approach where a user trying to leave their mark can spark up a conversation about another person's profile. And a passive approach, just sit back and listen to what people have to say about you, you have the power to continue the conversation.

			In this project we proposed an indoor localization scheme for drones only requiring readily accessible materials: an HD webcam an a regular Inkjet printer. It is common practice in computer vision to use two calibrated cameras to obtain the attitude and position of an object. Here we use a single calibrated camera, an object of known size (ARTag), and homography to obtain the attitude and position of an a drone. While a the use of a single ARTag may be acceptable for low speed tracking applications it is demonstrably insufficient for real time safety critical applications. To sufficiently increase the tracking reliability we added a substantial amount of redundancy in the system by designing a large rigid grid of ARTags. Because the size and location of the ARTags are fixed it is possible to use a rigid body transform from each unique ARTag to the origin. If the drone detects multiple ARTags the global position is averaged to remove artifacts.
