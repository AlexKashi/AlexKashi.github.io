                    <h1> Current Work </h1>
                    <p> 
                        I am currently a researcher at the Stanford Genome Technology Center. We have just submitted or paper our research to PNAS, where we differentiate 20 ME/CFS patients from 20 controls using a novel biosensor approach. The biosensor, named The Nanoneedle, is a highly sensitive impedance based sensor that consists of two 100 nm thick electrodes separated by a middle oxide layer with a thickness of 30 nm. The high sensitivity of the sensor is derived from its small sensing region. In the assay we developed, The Nanoneedle measures a patient's PBMCs (white blood cells), electrical response to an induced osmotic stress over the course of ~2.5 hours. With the goal of developing a classifier for ME/CFS we reduced the dimensionality of the of the impedance data from ~40,000 to 6 using a feature extraction algorithm I designed. We then used PCA on the extracted features to further reduce the dimensionality to 2. In PCA space the patients became separable from the controls using a polynomial kernel SVM.

		<h1> Current Projects </h1>


		<h2> Appling to Graduate School </h2>
		<text> I have been interested in research in and out of accademia ever since I was a Sophomore at Berkeley. To solidify a future in research, and be immersed in driven, like minded, individuals I have decided to pursue a Masters or PhD in Computer Science. </text>
		<h2> Building a Social Media Application (code not public)</h2>
		<text> When I am not at work, I like to keep busy with my side projects. I am currently building an android social media application that functions as the union of Instagram and Tinder/Bumble, and Twitter. I can not release many of the details regarding its function because of its revolutionary interface, but one of the major reasons I want to go to grad school is to find like minded highly driven individuals that are interested in taking risks and developing something revolutionary. I have currently developed the frontend, requiring 41 different java classes and over 30 layouts. This project has grown to become the largest project I have developed myself, requiring over 1000 hours. I am now hooking up the app to the AWS backend, and integrating The facebook and instagram APIs. </text>

		<text> My past classes and Companies like Google DeepMind have inspired me to complete this course in my own time. Follow me <a href=https://alexkashi.github.io/cs294.html>here</a> as I do the problemsets, my solutions to homework 1 and 2 can be found <a href=https://github.com/AlexKashi/homework>here.</a> Unfortunately I am not able to complete homework 3 and 4 until I get a new MuJoCo license which is required for running the physics simulations. I can't wait to continue learning about deep reinforcement learning in graduate school.</text>

		<text> In this project we proposed an indoor localization scheme for drones only requiring readily accessible materials: an HD webcam an a regular Inkjet printer. It is common practice in computer vision to use two calibrated cameras to obtain the attitude and position of an object. Here we use a single calibrated camera, an object of known size (ARTag), and homography to obtain the attitude and position of an a drone. While a the use of a single ARTag may be acceptable for low speed tracking applications it is demonstrably insufficient for real time safety critical applications. To sufficiently increase the tracking reliability we added a substantial amount of redundancy in the system by designing a large rigid grid of ARTags. Because the size and location of the ARTags are fixed it is possible to use a rigid body transform from each unique ARTag to the origin. If the drone detects multiple ARTags the global position is averaged to remove artifacts. </text>
